Using an after_initialize callback within a model to set an attribute causes a "missing
attribute error" when an ActiveRecord query is generated with a "select()" method that does
not select the attribute that is being set in Rails 3.1. 

In Rails 3.0, no error was given if the attribute being set in an after_initialize callback
was not selected.

Using Ruby 1.9.2p280, Rails 3.1, ubuntu 11.1 x64

How to reproduce bug.
1. Rake the database.
2. Navigate to "users/new".
3. Fill out the form with any parameters and create a user.
4. Navigate to "users/1" to view a working users#show page(users#show Line 19).
5. Navigate to "users/1?bug=true" to receive the missing attribute error(users#show Line 17).

Or
Run 'User.select(:name).first' in the console once a user has been created
